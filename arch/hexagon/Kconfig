config HEXAGON_VM
	bool "Hexagon Virtual Machine support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable Hexagon Virtual Machine support. This provides VM
	  instructions for interrupt control, timer operations, and
	  memory management.

config HEXAGON_HW_THREADS
	bool "Enable hardware thread support"

	help
	  Enable support for multiple hardware threads using Hexagon VM operations.
	  This allows threads to be assigned to specific virtual processors.

	  Enable enhanced QEMU support with debugging and networking features.

config HEXAGON_HVX
	bool "Hexagon Vector Extensions (HVX) support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for Hexagon Vector Extensions (HVX). HVX provides
	  SIMD vector processing capabilities with 32 vector registers and
	  vector predicate registers. This feature requires hardware support
	  and increases memory usage for thread context storage.

config HEXAGON_HVX_128B
	bool "Use 128-byte HVX vectors"
	default y
	help
	  Use 128-byte HVX vectors instead of 64-byte vectors. This provides
	  more vector processing capability but increases memory usage for
	  context storage. The actual vector size depends on hardware support.

config HEXAGON_HVX_MAX_CONTEXTS
	int "Maximum number of HVX contexts"
	default 4
	range 1 8
	help
	  Maximum number of HVX contexts that can be allocated simultaneously.
	  Set this to correspond with the target capability.
